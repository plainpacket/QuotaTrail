> A lightweight Android quota dashboard for Codex and other AI providers.

QuotaTrail is an unofficial Android app for keeping an eye on official quota usage across Claude, Codex, and other AI providers, from the home screen, the app dashboard, and a low-noise persistent notification.

## Features

- Official usage / quota / balance API data only.
- Quota windows shown as percentage, balance, usage count, or per-model buckets.
- Automatic currency conversion for balance providers (keeps the native amount).
- A 72-hour history chart showing 7-day and 5-hour remaining quota together in distinct colors.
- Resizable Jetpack Glance widget with four independent provider/account/limit slots, including mixed Claude and Codex views.
- One ongoing status notification showing Claude/Codex 5h and 7-day quota with each renewal date/time, plus a `Refresh all` action and per-account quota alerts.
- "Needs re-login" detection that notifies you.
- Multiple saved accounts with horizontal account paging and per-account quota alert toggles.
- Local history retention and history clearing.

## Background Refresh

QuotaTrail refreshes quota in the background with WorkManager (default every ~15 minutes), and never runs a foreground service for refresh. When the screen is off, Android's Doze mode batches background work into maintenance windows, so the actual cadence stretches well beyond your configured interval — this is expected OS behavior, not a bug.

**If QuotaTrail is not on the battery-optimization allowlist, background refresh may be delayed and the quota you see can be stale.** When that happens, open the app and refresh manually (pull to refresh, or the refresh button on Home). To make background refresh more reliable, **Settings → Refresh** offers a one-tap **Allow** shortcut that asks the system to exempt QuotaTrail from battery optimization — it only appears when the app is not yet exempt and is never forced. Even when granted, exact intervals remain subject to system scheduling.

## Download & Install

Grab the latest signed APK from the GitHub Releases page:

**→ [Download the latest release](https://github.com/plainpacket/QuotaTrail/releases/latest)** ([all releases](https://github.com/plainpacket/QuotaTrail/releases))

1. On your Android 12+ device, open the release and download the `.apk` asset.
2. When prompted, allow your browser or file manager to "install unknown apps".
3. Open the downloaded APK and tap **Install**.
4. Launch QuotaTrail and add an account to start tracking quota.

The app checks GitHub Releases for newer versions from the Settings screen; it never auto-installs and requests no storage permission.

## Privacy

QuotaTrail keeps sensitive data on the device.

- OAuth sessions are encrypted with Android Keystore-backed AES-GCM.
- Raw tokens, cookies, auth codes, full callback queries, raw usage responses, and complete `auth.json` content must never be logged, shown, or committed.
- There is no cloud sync, analytics SDK, remote logging, ad SDK, or third-party quota proxy.

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- StateFlow + ViewModel
- Room
- DataStore
- WorkManager
- Jetpack Glance
- OkHttp + kotlinx.serialization
- Android Keystore + AES-GCM
- Hand-written `ApplicationGraph`
